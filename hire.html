    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <br>

    <p>I am Christopher Harris, a self taught web developer and IT enthusiast. I began my interest
      in computers at an extremely young age and ever since has always been fascinated with technology.
      The pace in which engineering & development has taken the tech industry has been phenominal as both
      a hobbyist and avid learner of current web technologies.</p>

    <br>

    <p>As a hobbyist of PC building, a major research mindset comes into play
    when in search for the best items and upgrades at the best prices. Forever being
    on the look-out for new parts peaked my interest into how new and advanced technology
    can keeep producing updated models every other year and clearly display the benefits and
    accommodating features.</p>

    <br>

    <p>This began my path to functional programming. The beginning tutorial after the
      initial "Hello World!" introduction was a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Developing the basic concepts
    needed to complete this game using the javascript language with a bit of pre-build HTML & CSS.
     When I completed this personal challenge I felt estatic & excited that I had completed
     and build a basic interactive web based browser game.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Below are some of my sample design concepts, emulations and web page redesigns,
    as well as functions and features that can be implemented into almost any web page
    or web based application.</p>
