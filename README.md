// Enjoying recreating my portfolio to better enhance my current skills and provide a visual aid to potential recruiters looking for junior front end developers.

// Developing and implementing the sticky navigation bar gave me a challenge for placement when displaying a large welcoming banner. To overcome this challenge, i added a scroll by pixel parameter for the nav to display on a give amount of pixels scrolled on the webpage. I am still having issues when viewing the website on smaller devices and it reloads brining the whole website into an animation effect untill th nav bar has loaded in.
